# 3-Clothes_price_prediction

## Abstract
This project shows an end-to-end implementation of image classification using
Convolutional Neural Networks. The input data is a modified version of the FashionMNIST dataset where each image contains three articles and the sum of the prices is
the label of the image. The VGG-16 structure was the most accurate amongst other
types and was used to train a neural network. The learning rate, the momentum of
the optimizer, the number of epochs and the batch sizes hyperparameters were tuned.
The optimized values were lr = 10âˆ’2, momentum = 0:5, batch_size = 27 and
n_epoch = 50 which achieved 96:7% of accuracy on the validation set
